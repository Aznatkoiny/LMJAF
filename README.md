# Joke Rating App (Laura, My Jokes Are Funny)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Joke Rating App**, a quirky and personal project born out of a weekend coding challenge and a playful interaction with my girlfriend. This app is the result of a meta joke about her rating how poor my jokes were, so I decided to create a fun way for her to communicate her opinions on my humor.

## Features

- **Score Selection**: Users can select a score from 0 to 10 using a wheel picker.
- **Full Screen Display**: The selected score can be displayed in full screen for dramatic effect.
- **Personal Touch**: Includes a sweet message that adds a personal and humorous touch to the app.

## Technical Details

This project is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. The app consists of three main Swift files:

1. `ContentView.swift`: Contains the main view of the app, including the score picker and navigation.
2. `FullScreenScoreView.swift`: Displays the selected score in full screen.
3. `LauraMyJokesAreFunnyApp.swift`: The main app file that sets up the initial view.

## How to Use

1. Open the app and use the wheel picker to select a score from 0 to 10.
2. Tap "Show Full Screen" to view the selected score in a larger format.
3. Enjoy the personal message at the bottom of the main screen.

## Installation

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the app by:

- Changing the message in `ContentView.swift`
- Adjusting the font sizes and colors in both view files
- Adding additional features or screens to enhance the joke rating experience
